	SitSwap: One of the gazillion ideas I have over the period of my life. One of them was Swap-It. Swap-It is a platform where people can rent out their clothes. Or borrow funky clothes for a partayyy and lend their own clothes and earn some extra earnings.

	Apart from creating such a platform. there can be some hurdles as I see it:
	<ul>
		<li>Uncertainity</li>
		<li>Size of clothings</li>
		<li>Trust, cleanliness of clothes</li>
		
	</ul>
